TRANSLATION
OF

THE POEM:

1. Whilst in death the Hero of Verulam maleth
our Muses sueh lament, moistening their eyes:
2. Believe must we alae, that none after his fate
may be happy3 believe must we too, the old

one of Samos was unvise. '

e. He we lament, oannot be happy whilot the
Gamoenae are not3* for he loveth himself tar
less than his Muses.

4. But imperioue Clotho constraining, the reluctant
soul did soree drawing the unwilling feet
upward to the stans.

o. Must ve then believe Phoebus' Art was impetent,
and the herbe of Claros’ God have lost their
virtue?

e. Phoebus was potent as ever, and his herbe fell
not short in their virtue. Doubt daret thou

not, he hath his art and they have their

power. -

v. But Phoebus fearing him King over Camoenes
withheld from his rival, believe thou, the
hand oi his healing. ·

a. Hence is the pain; while Verulam’s Hero in all
arts greater wae, in thie was he lese.

o. Ye Oh Cainoenes but sorrovvful phantomS, ye
servera eo pallid of Jovie Infernae,
