And as he was a good Servant ιο his Master, ’
being never in nineteen years Service (as hc himself
averred) rebuhed by the King for any thing relating
ιο His Majesty‚ so hc was a good Master ιο his
Servants, and rewarded their long Attendance with
good Places freely when they fell into his Power:
which was the cause, that so many young Gentis
men of Blood and Quality sought ιο List themselves
in his Retinue. And if he were abused by any of
them in their Places, it twas onelyt the Error of the
gcodnessof his Nat ture, but the tBadges of their In-
discretione and lut temperanoes

This Lord was Religious: for though the World
be apt to suspect tand prejudice great tWits and Poli-
tichs ιο have somewhat of the Atheist ‚ yet he was
conversant with (lod, as appeareth by several Pas-
sagea throughout the whole Current of his Writings;
otherwise he should have crossed his own Principles‚
which were, That a little Philosophy maketh Men
apt ιο forget God, as attributing ιοο much ιο Secoml
Causes5 but depth ol Philosophy bringeth Men back
ιο (iod again. · Now I am sure there is no Man
that will deny him, or account otherwise of him,
hut ιο have him been adeep Philosopher. And not
onely so, but he was able ιο render areason of the
hope which was in him, which that Writing of his,
οι the confession of the Faith doth abundantly
testitie. He repaired frequently (when his Health
would permit him) to the Servios of the Church‚ to
hear Sermone, ιο the Administration of the Sacra-
ment of the blessed Body and Blood ol Christ3 and died
in the true Faith established in the Ohurch of England.

This is most true, he was free from¹ Malice,

which (as he said himself) hc never bred nor fed.
