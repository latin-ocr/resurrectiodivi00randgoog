the piace has appeared, as I shall prove, in the
Oolleolion of Lord Bacons posthumous works left '
by his Chaplain Dr. William Rawley. Thereiu Francis

Elisabethean Period‚ but indeed is addressed as
Shalrespeare3 for »Quirinus« (found in the seven-
teeuth disdeh) denotas clearly in English »Spearss
Swinger« or »·Shalrer«.

Dr. Rawley has ever appeared to me as the most
authentia, weighty and significant ol all biographieS,
that ever have been ventured upon this uuparalleled
man. This therefore l add.
